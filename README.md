=================

Example websites for incorporating Mathematics inside one's webpages

## Adding math to your webpage

The first folder `00_Add_Math` shows the bare minimum js and css files and tags for getting Tex to your site.

Subsequent examples are specialized for different aspects of html5-latex many of which focus of the interactivity extension of typical LaTeX syntax for dynamic graphs.

## Underpinning Technologies

I'm drawing mainly from the LaTeX2Html5 repository and MathJax for ability to post LaTeX to websites.
